## readme.md
Let's start from this file - this is the `readme.md` file which is placed into the root directory. 
It's displayed if the search field is empty. Also we don't filter / fulltext search over this file, so it's just for overview perposes.

## Search
Simple document searching is the most important part of the docs system. `search.md` describes all of the features about searching.
Please type `search.md` in search field and hit `enter` to open it.

## Project configuration
We prepared the `project-configuration.md` document to help you configure your first project. 
Please type `project-configuration.md` in search field and hit `enter` to open it.

## Markup
The site and the site markdown has little differences. `markup.md` shows you basic markup features. Checkout the sources and use it as reference.
Please type `markup.md` in search field and hit `enter` to open it.
